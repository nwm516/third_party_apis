# Integrating Third-Party APIs
This was an assignment for my Web Applications Development class. The objective: "Develop a small web application that integrates with a third-party API of your choice. This assignment is designed to enhance your skills in API integration, understanding documentation, and creating a functional application based on an API's capabilities."

# Application Usage
I ran "npm init" to initialize the project, and set the appropriate fields within the package.json file. Keeping the three files for this application together (ThirdPartyAPI.js, index.html, pokeStyle.css) in the same folder, then choosing to open index in a web broswer should keep everything running smoothly.
