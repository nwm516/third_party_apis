# Integrating Third-Party APIs
This was an assignment for my Web Applications Development class. The objective: "Develop a small web application that integrates with a third-party API of your choice. This assignment is designed to enhance your skills in API integration, understanding documentation, and creating a functional application based on an API's capabilities."

I made an application called "Where's That Pokemon?" that calls upon the PokeAPI.co API to run Pokemon information. In essence, this is supposed to be a very basic way of locating these particular Pokemon in-game by typing in who you are looking for and pushing the button for your result.

# Application Usage
I ran "npm init" to initialize the project, and set the appropriate fields within the package.json file. Keeping the files for this application together in the same folder, then choosing to open "index.hmtl" in a web broswer should keep everything running smoothly.
